      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a beginning software developer with a bachelors in Applied Meteorology...</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies range from paper mache to reading. Currently, I enjoy observing local weather phenomenon and comparing my observations with news forecasts.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to research more into thunderstorm development using a deep neural network model to measure storm development parameters.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently, I live in Sanbornville, NH</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always been fascinated with the aspects of wed design but have never quite found a good starting off point to begin designing a website.
        Eventually, I want to incorporate the skills I learn from the course to better focus my direction in generating appropriate parameters for designing my weather model.</p>
